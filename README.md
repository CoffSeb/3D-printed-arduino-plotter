During spring of 2020 I made a 3d printed plotter for my electronics course at University of Helsinki. This was a group project. There where 2 other partisipanst in the project.

The plotter has fully custom 3D printed frame. To give the machine more presition it has liniar rails, leniar bearings, beared steppermotors and GT2 belts to move the platform.

All of the 3d modeling, printing and assembling of the machine was done by me.
