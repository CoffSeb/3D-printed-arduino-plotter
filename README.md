During spring of 2020 I made a 3d printed plotter for my electronics course at University of Helsinki. This was a group project. There where 2 other partisipanst in the project.

The plotter has fully custom 3D printed frame. To give the machine more presition it has liniar rails, leniar bearings, beared steppermotors and GT2 belts to move the platform.

All of the 3d modeling, printing and assembling of the machine was done by me.

The software is run in arduino software. The softrare reads g code instructions trough serial port that are sen by program called prosessing. Both of these files are listed in this folder. There is also repport of the project. I will release the .stl files later.
